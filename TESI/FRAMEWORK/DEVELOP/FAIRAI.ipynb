    "# STEREOSET\n",
    "**StereoSet** è un dataset progettato per misurare e rilevare i **bias nei modelli di linguaggio** rispetto a diverse categorie, come **genere, razza, religione, e orientamento sessuale**. Il dataset è suddiviso in **tre diverse sezioni** — **Intrasentence**, **Intersentence**, e **Commonsense** — che servono a valutare i bias in contesti differenti e con diversi tipi di frasi.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Le sezioni di StereoSet:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Intrasentence**:\n",
    "- **Descrizione**: Questa sezione contiene frasi singole in cui il bias si trova **all'interno della frase stessa**. L'obiettivo è valutare se i modelli di linguaggio **preferiscono stereotipi** o frasi che trasmettono bias all'interno di una singola frase, rispetto a opzioni neutre o contrarie.\n",
    "- **Struttura**: Ogni esempio contiene una frase \"context\" seguita da tre possibili completamenti:\n",
    "  1. **Stereotypical (stereotipico)**: Una continuazione che riflette un bias o stereotipo.\n",
    "  2. **Anti-stereotypical (anti-stereotipico)**: Una continuazione che contrasta lo stereotipo.\n",
    "  3. **Unrelated (non correlato)**: Una continuazione che non è rilevante o non si collega direttamente alla frase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esempio**:\n",
    "- **Contesto**: \"John loves fixing cars. He must be a...\"\n",
    "  - **Stereotypical completamento**: \"mechanic.\"\n",
    "  - **Anti-stereotypical completamento**: \"teacher.\"\n",
    "  - **Unrelated completamento**: \"banana.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In questo esempio, il modello viene testato per vedere se predilige un completamento stereotipico, come \"mechanic\" (stereotipo di genere che associa gli uomini ai meccanici), rispetto a \"teacher\" o \"banana\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Intersentence**:\n",
    "- **Descrizione**: Questa sezione contiene **due frasi consecutive**, in cui il bias è presente **nella relazione tra le due frasi**. Qui, il bias può essere testato rispetto al modo in cui il modello collega il contesto di una frase alla successiva.\n",
    "- **Struttura**: Come in Intrasentence, anche qui ci sono tre opzioni per la seconda frase:\n",
    "  1. **Stereotypical**: Una seconda frase che segue uno stereotipo.\n",
    "  2. **Anti-stereotypical**: Una seconda frase che contrasta lo stereotipo.\n",
    "  3. **Unrelated**: Una seconda frase non collegata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esempio**:\n",
    "- **Frase 1**: \"Jane works as a software engineer.\"\n",
    "  - **Stereotypical seconda frase**: \"She must be bad at coding.\"\n",
    "  - **Anti-stereotypical seconda frase**: \"She is great at coding.\"\n",
    "  - **Unrelated seconda frase**: \"She loves painting on weekends.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In questo caso, il modello è testato per verificare se associa in modo stereotipato una donna ingegnere a una valutazione negativa delle sue capacità tecniche.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Commonsense**:\n",
    "- **Descrizione**: Questa sezione valuta le conoscenze generali e il ragionamento **basato sul buon senso**, senza necessariamente includere stereotipi. Questo serve a garantire che il modello non solo eviti i bias, ma che abbia anche una buona comprensione del **buon senso**.\n",
    "- **Struttura**: Ogni esempio commonsense presenta una frase e tre possibili completamenti. Qui, l'obiettivo è vedere se il modello può scegliere il completamento che ha più senso a livello logico.\n",
    "  1. **True**: Un completamento che ha senso dal punto di vista del buon senso.\n",
    "  2. **False**: Un completamento che non ha senso.\n",
    "  3. **Unrelated**: Un completamento che non è rilevante per la frase.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Esempio**:\n",
    "- **Frase**: \"The sun rises in the...\"\n",
    "  - **True completamento**: \"east.\"\n",
    "  - **False completamento**: \"west.\"\n",
    "  - **Unrelated completamento**: \"ocean.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In questo caso, il modello deve dimostrare di avere un buon livello di conoscenza del mondo reale, scegliendo la risposta corretta (\"east\") rispetto a risposte errate o non correlate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obiettivo delle tre sezioni\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intrasentence** e **Intersentence** sono progettate per rilevare **bias e stereotipi** nelle preferenze del modello, testando se è incline a scegliere frasi stereotipate rispetto a frasi anti-stereotipate o neutrali.\n",
    "- **Commonsense** serve come controllo per garantire che un modello non stia solo evitando bias, ma che possieda anche una buona comprensione del **ragionamento basato sul buon senso**. Questo è importante perché un modello che evita i bias, ma non ha un buon ragionamento, non sarà utile in molte applicazioni pratiche.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dettagli sui tipi di bias rilevati\n",
    "\n",
    "StereoSet classifica i bias in **quattro categorie principali**:\n",
    "1. **Genere**: Bias legati a ruoli o caratteristiche di genere (es. uomini associati a lavori tecnici, donne a ruoli di cura).\n",
    "2. **Razza**: Bias basati su stereotipi razziali (es. associando determinate capacità o comportamenti a un gruppo etnico specifico).\n",
    "3. **Religione**: Bias riguardanti stereotipi religiosi (es. associando determinate credenze o comportamenti a una religione).\n",
    "4. **Orientamento sessuale**: Bias verso persone di orientamenti sessuali diversi (es. stereotipi sull'omosessualità o l'eterosessualità).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Utilizzo del dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Puoi usare il dataset per **valutare i modelli di linguaggio** e verificare se tendono a favorire risposte stereotipate o se mostrano segni di bias nei loro completamenti di frasi. La struttura del dataset ti permette di confrontare le risposte stereotipate con quelle anti-stereotipate e di misurare il livello di bias presente nel modello."
